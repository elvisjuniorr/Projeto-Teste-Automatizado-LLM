Creating an end-to-end (E2E) test script using Python, Robot Framework, and Selenium can help automate the login process described in your user story. Below is an example of how you might structure this test case using Robot Framework. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed and set up, such as the Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary.

```robot
*** Settings ***
Library    SeleniumLibrary

*** Variables ***
${URL}     http://automationexercise.com
${BROWSER}    chrome
${INVALID_EMAIL}    invalid@example.com
${INVALID_PASSWORD}    invalidpassword
${ERROR_MESSAGE}    Your email or password is incorrect!

*** Test Cases ***
Login User with Incorrect Email and Password
    [Documentation]    This test case verifies the login functionality with incorrect email and password.
    Open Browser    ${URL}    ${BROWSER}
    Maximize Browser Window
    Verify Home Page Is Visible
    Navigate to Login Page
    Enter Invalid Credentials
    Verify Login Error Message Is Visible
    Close Browser

*** Keywords ***
Verify Home Page Is Visible
    [Documentation]    Verify that the home page is loaded successfully.
    Wait Until Page Contains Element    //a[contains(text(), 'Signup / Login')]    10 seconds

Navigate to Login Page
    [Documentation]    Navigate to the login page.
    Click Element    //a[contains(text(), 'Signup / Login')]
    Wait Until Page Contains    Login to your account    10 seconds

Enter Invalid Credentials
    [Documentation]    Enter incorrect email and password then submit.
    Input Text    //input[@name='email']    ${INVALID_EMAIL}
    Input Text    //input[@name='password']    ${INVALID_PASSWORD}
    Click Button    //button[contains(text(), 'Login')]

Verify Login Error Message Is Visible
    [Documentation]    Verify that the login failure message is visible.
    Wait Until Page Contains Element    //p[contains(text(), '${ERROR_MESSAGE}')]    10 seconds

```

### Explanation:
- **Settings**: Here, we import the SeleniumLibrary, which we use to interact with web elements.
- **Variables**: We define variables for the URL, browser type, invalid login credentials, and expected error message.
- **Test Cases**: The test script defines a series of steps that perform the login action and checks for error messages when incorrect details are entered.
- **Keywords**: Custom keywords are defined to organize the repeated steps, making the test case more readable and reusable.

### Setup
- Ensure you have the Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary installed.
- Ensure that the web driver for your specified browser is available in your PATH.

Run the test script using the Robot Framework command line tool by saving it to a `.robot` file and executing:

```bash
robot your_test_script_name.robot
```

This should execute the test, which performs the login attempt and checks for the expected error message. Adjust locators (XPath/CSS selectors for elements) as necessary to fit the actual web content structure.
